    <pre>using tag "pre"...
let's see how it works...
it seems to work very well... great!
I can skip lines without need to use another tag "p"!
Well, in the end, you don't need to use necessary new tags "p" to make 
break lines!Wait, you can use the tah "br" in the middle of a tag "p".Well, 
you can use both pre and p tags that it will works, just remember to use
"br" tag in the middle of "p" tag
